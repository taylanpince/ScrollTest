ScrollTest
==========

A basic iPad project to put together an application that mimics Apple's own
photo viewer. Currently supports:

* Queued loading for optimized view recycling
* Thumbnails browser in the bottom toolbar
* Proper rotation support (images rotate around their own center)
* Async loading of all images (supports file paths as well as urls)
* Automated resizing in background thread
* Local image caching for faster performance
* Support for leaving the viewer by pinching the active photo

Current memory consumption is under 10MB with a 130 image gallery (usually 
stays around 8MB). Consumption doesn't grow over time, no matter how many 
images you have. UI performance is now at par with Apple's Photos app.
