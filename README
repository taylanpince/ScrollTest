ScrollTest
==========

A basic iPad project to put together an application that mimics Apple's own
photo viewer. Currently supports:

* Queued loading for optimized view recycling
* Thumbnails browser in a toolbar
* Proper rotation support (images rotate around their own center)

This project is meant as a test bed for UI behavior, image loads are extremely
suboptimal. If you take any parts of the code, please make sure you roll
your own image loader that will handle fetching, resizing and caching in a 
background thread.
