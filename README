ScrollTest
==========

A basic iPad project to put together an application that mimics Apple's own
photo viewer. Currently supports:

* Queued loading for optimized view recycling
* Thumbnails browser in the bottom toolbar
* Proper rotation support (images rotate around their own center)
* Async loading of all images (supports file paths as well as urls)
* Automated resizing in background thread
* Local image caching for faster performance

Current memory consumption is around 15MB with a 130 image gallery. Going to
work on improving this a bit more, but it's pretty good as is. Consumption
doesn't grow over time, no matter how many images you have.

There are still a few quirks with thumbnail browsing (on the device, it doesn't
jump as fast as I would like it to).
